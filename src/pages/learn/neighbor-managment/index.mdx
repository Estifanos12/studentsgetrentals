## Neighbor Management

Homeowners prioritize renting to individuals who get along well with their neighbors, as neighbor disputes can lead to significant issues. Here are ten common reasons why neighbors might end up in conflict:

1. **Noise Complaints:** Loud music, parties, pets, or loud vehicles at odd hours can lead to friction.
2. **Pets:** Issues related to pets, including barking, roaming freely, and property damage.
3. **Parking:** Disputes over limited parking spaces or parking in front of each otherâ€™s houses.
4. **Property Maintenance:** Poor maintenance leading to an eyesore or decreased property values.
5. **Privacy:** Invasion of privacy through observation, surveillance cameras, or structures.
