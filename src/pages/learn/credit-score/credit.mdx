## Credit Scores

Your credit score is like a financial report card that landlords use to evaluate how reliably you'll pay your rent. It's derived from your credit history, including how timely you've paid past bills, the amount of credit you're using, and any debts or loans you might have. A high credit score suggests that you're financially responsible, making you a more attractive candidate to landlords. They want assurance that you'll pay rent on time and in full, and your credit score is a key indicator of this ability.

Having a low credit score doesn't make renting impossible, but it may limit your options or result in higher security deposits. It's a good idea to check your credit score before you start looking for rentals so you have time to improve it if necessary. Paying down outstanding debts and ensuring all your bills are paid on time can help boost your score.
