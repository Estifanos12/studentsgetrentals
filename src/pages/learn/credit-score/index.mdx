## In Summary

Both your credit score and landlord references play pivotal roles in the rental application process. They're tools landlords use to mitigate risk and ensure they're leasing their property to someone trustworthy. By maintaining a good credit score and being a responsible tenant, you'll find it easier to secure rentals and negotiate favorable lease terms. Always keep in mind that renting is more than just finding a place to liveâ€”it's an agreement of trust between you and the landlord, and these components help build and demonstrate that trust.
