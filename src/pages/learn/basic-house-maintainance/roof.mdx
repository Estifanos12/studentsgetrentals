## Roof

Identifying roof issues early can prevent minor problems from becoming major, costly repairs. Here are key signs that indicate potential roof issues:

1. **Visible Roof Damage**

    - **Missing, Cracked, or Curled Shingles:** This can allow water to enter and damage the structure beneath.
    - **Damaged or Missing Flashing:** Flashing is used to seal edges, perimeters, walls, and valleys where the roof meets other surfaces. Damage here can lead to leaks.

2. **Sagging Roof**

    - A sagging roof deck indicates structural issues, possibly due to long-term water damage or inadequate support.

3. **Signs of Water Damage Inside**

    - **Water Stains on Ceilings or Walls:** These often look like large, discolored patches and may indicate a leak.
    - **Mold or Mildew Growth:** Particularly in the attic or on ceilings, this can be a sign of moisture problems from a leaky roof.

4. **Granules in Gutters**

    - If your roof has asphalt shingles, finding granules in the gutters or downspouts can be a sign of shingle wear.

5. **Light Coming Through the Roof**

    - Seeing light in your attic coming through the roof is a clear indication of holes or gaps that need immediate attention.

6. **Increased Energy Bills**

    - Unexplained increases in heating or cooling costs might indicate that your roof is no longer properly insulating your home.

7. **Age of the Roof**

    - If your roof is older than its expected lifespan, it may be time for an inspection or replacement.

8. **Leaks After Heavy Rainfall**

    - If you notice leaks inside your home during or after heavy rain, it's a clear sign of roof problems.

9. **Moss, Algae, or Fungi Growth**

    - While some growths can be superficial, extensive moss or algae coverage, especially on the roof, can trap moisture and deteriorate roofing material over time.

10. **Clogged Gutters**
    - While not directly a roof issue, gutters clogged with shingle granules or debris can indicate roof wear and can also lead to water damage to your home's structure.

If you notice any of these signs, it's important to have a professional roofing contractor inspect your roof to assess the extent of the issues and recommend appropriate repairs or replacement. Regular maintenance and inspections can extend the life of your roof and help avoid unexpected problems.
